## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Joyride Note Manager: AI-Powered Contextual Note Organization That Thinks With You**

*Revolutionary note-taking system automatically understands and organizes your thoughts based on what you're working on, when you're working, and how you think*

---

### The Problem We Solve

Developers and knowledge workers struggle with fragmented note-taking that loses context. Traditional note apps don't understand that a quick jot about a bug fix while reviewing code at 2 PM on Tuesday should be organized differently than a weekend brainstorm about project architecture. Notes get lost in folders, forgotten in files, or worse—never captured at all because the friction is too high.

### Introducing Joyride Note Manager

Today we're announcing Joyride Note Manager, an AI-powered note organization system that captures your thoughts instantly and organizes them intelligently based on the full context of your work.

**Key Innovation: Context-Aware AI Organization**

Unlike traditional note apps that require you to choose folders and categories, Joyride Note Manager's AI agent automatically understands:
- What workspace you're in and what file you're looking at
- The time of day and season (meeting notes vs late-night insights)
- Your existing note patterns and organizational preferences
- The semantic relationship between new notes and your knowledge base

### How It Works

**Lightning-Fast Capture**: Hit your hotkey, type your thought, press Enter. The input box stays focused until you're done—no context switching, no mental overhead.

**Intelligent Processing**: Our AI agent reads your note alongside rich context—current file, workspace state, time patterns, and your personal note organization instructions—then decides the perfect place and format for storage.

**Adaptive Organization**: Notes are stored as individual files with smart frontmatter (tags, categories, relationships) in a flat structure that's both human-readable and AI-navigable. No complex hierarchies to maintain.

**Effortless Retrieval**: Fuzzy search through all notes with instant preview, filter by tags/categories, or let the AI surface relevant notes based on your current work context.

### Customer Quotes

*"I used to lose great ideas because opening a note app broke my flow. Now I just hit Ctrl+Alt+N, brain-dump, and trust that it'll be perfectly organized when I need it later."*
— Sarah Chen, Senior Frontend Developer

*"The AI actually understands that my 'TODO: refactor auth' note while looking at user.cljs should be categorized with security tasks, not random todos. It's like having a personal knowledge management assistant."*
— Alex Rodriguez, Full-Stack Developer

### Special Features for Deep Thinkers

**Ask-Me Mode**: Prefix any note with `/ask-me` and the AI will intelligently interview you to flesh out incomplete thoughts. Perfect for capturing seed ideas that need development.

**Seasonal Intelligence**: Notes jotted during crunch time get different organization treatment than weekend exploration notes. The AI learns your work rhythms.

**Project Context**: Workspace-specific notes stay with projects, while personal insights flow to your global knowledge base—automatically, without you thinking about it.

### Available Today

Joyride Note Manager launches today as part of the Joyride ecosystem for VS Code. Installation takes 30 seconds, setup is zero—just start jotting and let the AI learn your patterns.

**Pricing**: Free and open source, like all Joyride tools.

### About Joyride

Joyride transforms VS Code into a programmable, AI-enhanced development environment where creativity meets productivity. Our tools help developers automate their workflow, extend their editor, and now—never lose a good idea again.

### FAQs

**Q: Will my notes be private?**
A: THe notes will be stored on your computer, in the current workspace and/or in the Joyride user directory. The notes will stored be as private as those locations are. AI will be processing the notes so to keep things strictly private, use a local model.

**Q: What if the AI organizes something wrong?**
A: The flat file structure with frontmatter means you and Copilot can always manually reorganize. Plus, the fuzzy search finds anything regardless of where it's filed.

**Q: Does it work without internet?**
A: Only if you use a local model.

**Q: Can I customize the organization logic?**
A: Yes! Edit your `.joyride/notes/.instructions.md` file to teach the AI your preferred organization patterns. Also, this is a Joyride script, just change anything you want about it.

### Technical Details

Built on Joyride's ClojureScript runtime, leveraging VS Code's extension API for seamless integration. Supports markdown with full frontmatter metadata.
