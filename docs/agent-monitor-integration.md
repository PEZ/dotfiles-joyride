# Agent Monitor Integration Complete

## What Changed

The autonomous agent system now includes full integration with the agent monitor for visual tracking and centralized logging.

### Modified Files

**`src/ai_workflow/agents.cljs`**
- Added `ai-workflow.agent-monitor` namespace require
- Added `caller` parameter to `autonomous-conversation!+` (optional, defaults to "autonomous-agent")
- Threaded `conv-id` through conversation loop
- Replaced all `println` calls with `monitor/log-to-agent-channel!`
- Added conversation status updates at key lifecycle points
- Added flare updates after status changes
- Start monitoring registers conversation before agent begins work
- Final status update reflects completion reason (`:done`, `:error`, `:max-turns-reached`)

## New Behavior

### Visual Tracking
- All autonomous conversations now appear in the **Sub Agents Monitor** (sidebar slot 1)
- Real-time status updates: ‚è∏Ô∏è started ‚Üí ‚öôÔ∏è working ‚Üí ‚úÖ done or ‚ùå error
- Shows: conversation ID, caller, model, turn progress, scrollable goal

### Centralized Logging
- All agent activity logs to **"Sub Agents" output channel**
- ID-prefixed messages: `[conv-id] message`
- Accessible via "Show Logs" button in monitor flare
- No more terminal stdout clutter (except tool execution internals)

### Conversation Lifecycle

1. **Start**: `start-monitoring-conversation!+` registers and logs initial message
2. **Turn Updates**: Each turn logs status and updates current turn count
3. **AI Responses**: Agent thoughts logged with ü§ñ prefix
4. **Tool Execution**: Tool calls logged with üîß prefix, results with ‚úÖ
5. **Completion**: Final status logged with üéØ, conversation marked as `:done` or `:error`

## Usage

### Basic Usage (No Changes Required)

Existing code continues to work:

```clojure
(autonomous-conversation!+ "Your goal here"
                           {:tool-ids ["tool1" "tool2"]
                            :max-turns 10})
```

This will show as caller "autonomous-agent" in the monitor.

### With Custom Caller

Identify which script/context initiated the conversation:

```clojure
(autonomous-conversation!+ "Your goal here"
                           {:tool-ids ["tool1" "tool2"]
                            :caller "my-automation-script"
                            :max-turns 10})
```

### Multiple Concurrent Conversations

Run multiple agents simultaneously - each gets unique ID and tracking:

```clojure
;; Start multiple tasks
(p/let [task1 (autonomous-conversation!+ "Task 1" {:caller "batch-processor-1"})
        task2 (autonomous-conversation!+ "Task 2" {:caller "batch-processor-2"})
        task3 (autonomous-conversation!+ "Task 3" {:caller "batch-processor-3"})]
  ;; All three show up in monitor with separate logs
  [task1 task2 task3])
```

## Monitoring Features

### Check Active Conversations

```clojure
(require '[ai-workflow.agent-monitor :as monitor])

;; Get all conversations
(monitor/get-all-conversations)

;; Get specific conversation
(monitor/get-conversation conv-id)

;; Manually refresh flare
(monitor/update-agent-monitor-flare!+)
```

### Access Logs

- Click **"üìã Show Logs"** button in monitor flare
- Or open Output panel ‚Üí Select "Sub Agents" from dropdown
- Search/filter by conversation ID: `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.

## Testing

Verified functionality:
- ‚úÖ Conversation registration and ID generation
- ‚úÖ Real-time flare updates during agent execution
- ‚úÖ Status transitions through lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Error handling and error status display
- ‚úÖ Concurrent conversation tracking
- ‚úÖ Output channel logging with ID prefixes
- ‚úÖ "Show Logs" button reveals output channel

## Benefits

1. **No stdout pollution**: Agent chatter goes to dedicated channel
2. **Visual progress tracking**: See all active agents at a glance
3. **Historical record**: Completed conversations remain in monitor
4. **Concurrent agent management**: Track multiple agents simultaneously
5. **Debugging support**: ID-prefixed logs easy to filter and trace
6. **Caller identification**: Know which script/context started each conversation

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add "Stop" button to cancel running conversations
- Filter conversations by status/caller in flare
- Export conversation logs to file
- Click conversation in monitor to jump to specific log section
- Clear completed conversations button
- Conversation duration tracking
